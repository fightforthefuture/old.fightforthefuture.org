Activists fly blimp as part of awareness raising nationwide “Rock Against the TPP” tour featuring celebrities and musicians</i></h2><p>SACRAMENTO, CA––8:00am PST: Activists involved with the nationwide <a href="http://rockagainstthetpp.org/" target="_blank"><b>Rock Against the TPP</b></a> celebrity concert tour are now taking their message directly to local lawmakers, flying a 25’ inflatable blimp outside Representative Ami Bera’s office at 8950 Cal Center Drive, Sacramento, CA, protesting the Congressman’s recent statements in support of the unpopular and anti-democratic Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal.</p><p><b>See more PHOTOS and VIDEO of the blimp at the bottom of this post.</b></p><p>Activists will remain outside the office with the blimp until 11:00am PST, ensuring that it’s visible to Congressional staff as they arrive for work this morning. They will be available for interviews about the action and the TPP.</p><p>&ldquo;Ami Bera turned his back on constituents when he voted to fast track the TPP.  We’re hoping a 25-foot blimp flying right outside his office makes it clear to him that supporting the TPP is betraying his constituents,&rdquo; <b>said Robert Longer of CWA Local 9421.</b></p><p>In January, Rep. Bera failed to secure the endorsement of the local Democratic Party for his re-election to Congress, in large part due to continued constituent anger over his 2015 vote in favor of “fast track” legislation that will allow the TPP to circumvent ordinary congressional review, amendment and debate procedures.  He is among a small minority of congressional Democrats not publicly opposed to the TPP.</p><p>“The TPP is a back-room deal designed to rig the global economy even further in favor of corporate elites instead of working families,”<b> said Fabrizio Sasso, Executive Director of the Sacramento Central Labor Council.</b> “Congress members who think they can side with Wall Street over their constituents on the TPP are going to be in for a rude awakening.”</p><p>The airborne protest is part of the <a href="http://rockagainstthetpp.org/" target="_blank"><b>Rock Against the TPP</b></a> tour, a nationwide series of large-scale concert, protest, and teach-in events featuring high profile musicians and celebrities like T<b>om Morello</b> (Rage Against the Machine) Golden Globe nominated actress <b>Evangeline Lilly</b> <i>(Lost, The Hobbit, Ant-Man)</i>, hip hop icon <b>Talib Kweli,</b> comedian <b>Hari Kondabolu,</b> popular punk band Anti-Flag, Jello Biafra of the <b>Dead Kennedys</b>, and Danbert Nobacon of <b>Chumbawamba</b>. The goal of the tour is to raise awareness about the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, the unpopular and anti-democratic “trade deal” that has been a contentious issue in the Presidential election and at both of the recent political conventions.</p><p>Organized by legendary guitarist Tom Morello’s new label, Firebrand Records and digital rights group Fight for the Future, the tour is sponsored by Backbone Campaign, Citizens Trade Campaign, Communications Workers of America, CREDO, Demand Progress, Friends of the Earth, the International Labor Rights Forum, Private Internet Access, Public Citizen, Sierra Club, SumOfUs, the Teamsters, and United Steelworkers.</p><p>See photos and video from the tour kick-off event <a href="https://medium.com/@fightfortheftr/photos-video-massive-crowd-giant-blimp-protests-trans-pacific-partnership-at-rock-against-the-1733f9ed1fa1" target="_blank"><b>here.</b></a></p><p>The tour stopped in San Diego earlier this month, where activists <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2016-08-01-breaking-anti-tpp-activists-are-flying-a-25/'" target="_blank"><b>flew the same blimp</b></a> outside Rep Scott Peters’ office.

The petitions call for the military to provide Chelsea with adequate and humane treatment for both her gender dysphoria and her suicide attempt.  </p><p><b>See more photos of the petition delivery below.</b></p><p><b>On a press call following the delivery, Chelsea’s attorney at the ACLU, Chase Strangio, said:</b> “Chelsea&rsquo;s access to mental health care has been inconsistent. It is an ongoing concern of her attorneys and supporters that she is not getting adequate mental health care, particularly in light of the external forces that are destabilizing her mental health, like the service of these administrative charges against her and the ongoing investigation of those charges. It seems like the government is doing everything in their power to make her physical and mental condition worsen. Punishment for these charges could not only result in significant punishment, including indefinite solitary confinement, but also loss of access to the very things that connect Chelsea&rsquo;s voice with the world.”</p><p><b>Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, said,</b> “No harm has resulted from Chelsea Manning&rsquo;s disclosures. Not giving her the proper medical treatment and then adding on these charges for her suicide attempt would seem designed to break her down as a human being. These charges appear to me to be sadistic and outrageous.”</p><p>Ms. Manning attempted to take her own life in July after years of mistreatment in prison, and now the U.S. government is threatening to punish her further with serious <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2016-07-28-chelsea-manning-faces-new-charges-indefinite/" target="_blank">new charges</a> directly related to her suicide attempt, which could lead to her being placed in indefinite solitary confinement, among other consequences. The 115,000 petition signatures came from petitions launched by grassroots activist groups supporting Chelsea: <a href="https://www.freechelsea.com/" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>, <a href="https://act.demandprogress.org/sign/drop-the-admin-charges-against-chelsea-manning-now/" target="_blank">Demand Progress</a>, <a href="http://act.rootsaction.org/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=12415" target="_blank">RootsAction</a>, <a href="http://org.salsalabs.com/o/498/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=20166" target="_blank">Bill of Rights Defense Committee</a>, and <a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/766/997/768/tell-the-army-not-to-put-chelsea-manning-into-solitary-confinement-for-attempting-suicide/" target="_blank">Care2</a>.</p><p>Last year, a similar petition effort helped <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/18/chelsea-manning-supporters-deliver-petition-drop-charges" target="_blank">draw attention</a> to Chelsea’s situation when she faced solitary confinement for minor prison “infractions” including possession of an expired tube of toothpaste.</p><p>###</p><p>The photos below are available for use by press, please credit: &ldquo;Courtesy Demand Progress.”</p><figure data-orig-width="4000" data-orig-height="2992" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://67.media.tumblr.com/d8d97829e6ed145e7f699ac8e380687f/tumblr_inline_obpflkuYBr1ri3xd7_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="4000" data-orig-height="2992"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="958" data-orig-height="1280" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/98cf85e3363491bee7cad05db84d0395/tumblr_inline_obpfjl8Wwa1ri3xd7_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="958" data-orig-height="1280"/></figure>

        <span class="date">Posted 09:07 EDT on August 9, 2016</span>


        <p>Media Advisory For August 10, 2016<b><br/></b></p><p>Contact:<br/>Christina DiPasquale, <a href="mailto:christina@balestramedia.com" target="_blank">christina@balestramedia.com</a>, 202-716-1953<br/>Evan Greer, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a>, 978-852-6457</p><h2><i>Fight for the Future, Demand Progress, RootsAction, and Care2 will deliver 100,000+ petition signatures to Secretary of the Army on Wednesday</i></h2><p>WASHINGTON, DC––This Wednesday, August 10, Chelsea Manning supporters will host a press conference by phone at 12:00 noon EST on the charges faced by Chelsea Manning in connection to her suicide attempt and efforts being made by supporters demanding that Secretary of the Army Eric Fanning drop the charges against Ms. Manning, and provide her with adequate treatment for both her gender dysphoria and her suicide attempt.  </p><p>The press call will follow the delivery of more than 115,000 petition signatures to the Secretary of the Army and will feature Chelsea’s attorney at the ACLU, <b>Chase Strangio</b>, Pentagon Papers whistleblower <b>Daniel Ellsberg</b>, Fight for the Future’s campaign director, <b>Evan Greer</b>, who speaks to Chelsea on the phone regularly, and <b>David Segal</b>, executive director of Demand Progress, who assisted with the physical delivery of the petitions to the Secretary of the Army.</p><p><b>To receive call-in details, RSVP to: <a href="mailto:christina@balestramedia.com" target="_blank">christina@balestramedia.com</a> or <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a> </b></p><p>Ms. Manning attempted to take her own life after years of mistreatment in prison, and now the U.S. government is threatening to punish her further with serious <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2016-07-28-chelsea-manning-faces-new-charges-indefinite/" target="_blank"><b>new charges</b></a> directly related to her suicide attempt in July, which could lead to her being placed in indefinite solitary confinement, among other consequences. Signatures come from petitions launched by grassroots activist groups supporting Chelsea: <a href="https://www.freechelsea.com/" target="_blank"><b>Fight for the Future</b></a>, <b><a href="https://act.demandprogress.org/sign/drop-the-admin-charges-against-chelsea-manning-now/" target="_blank">Demand Progress</a>,</b> <b><a href="http://act.rootsaction.org/p/dia/action3/common/public/?action_KEY=12415" target="_blank">RootsAction</a>,</b> and <b><a href="http://www.thepetitionsite.com/766/997/768/tell-the-army-not-to-put-chelsea-manning-into-solitary-confinement-for-attempting-suicide/" target="_blank">Care2</a>.</b></p><p>Last year, a similar petition effort helped <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/aug/18/chelsea-manning-supporters-deliver-petition-drop-charges" target="_blank">draw attention</a> to Chelsea’s situation when she faced solitary confinement for minor prison “infractions” including possession of an expired tube of toothpaste. </p><p>“Chelsea Manning is a human being who deserves to be treated with basic dignity and respect,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, </b>“The U.S. government’s treatment of her will be remembered as one of the most shameful abuses of power in our nation’s history. Everyone who cares about human rights should be speaking out against this cruelty and injustice right now.”</p><p>&ldquo;Adding additional punishment on top of Chelsea Manning&rsquo;s already unjust sentence, and threatening her with indefinite solitary confinement for attempting to take her own life, is an egregious miscarriage of justice,&rdquo; <b>said Kate Kizer, campaigner at Demand Progress.</b> &ldquo;The government&rsquo;s inhumane reaction to Ms. Manning&rsquo;s attempted suicide is part of an ongoing pattern of mistreatment that appears to be an attempt to silence Chelsea’s important voice.&rdquo;</p><p>###</p>
