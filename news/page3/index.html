Over the weekend, thousands of people started taking part in a spontaneous <a href="http://hugsforchelsea.com" target="_blank">#HugsForChelsea</a> campaign, posting photos of themselves with their arms outstretched as if waiting to give Chelsea Manning a hug, calling for President Obama to grant her clemency. Some prominent individuals including <a href="https://twitter.com/dustinkensrue/status/820436190092558336" target="_blank">Michael Stipe</a> of REM have joined the effort. </p><p><b>See a selection of #HugsForChelsea photos here: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/GS2Tw" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/GS2Tw</a> </b></p><p><b>See the landing page for the campaign <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/hugsforchelsea-give-chelsea-manning-a-hug/" target="_blank">here.</a></b></p><p>“Chelsea has so much love and support coming from people across the political spectrum,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, who posted the first #HugsForChelsea photo, “She has suffered enough.

        <span class="date">Posted 08:42 EST on January 14, 2017</span>

The announcement comes amid growing public outcry about the plan, which would have given local police Orwellian capabilities to constantly scan and analyze online speech in the area.<br/></p><p>“This is a huge victory and offers a glimmer of hope for our basic rights at a time when it is in short supply,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, a group that led efforts to oppose the BPD’s surveillance aspirations, “Mass surveillance programs like the one the Boston Police intended to launch don’t actually make us safer, but they have a profoundly chilling effect on freedom of speech and our basic civil rights.”</p><p>Last month, digital rights group Fight for the Future and a dozen other civil liberties organizations <a href="http://www.wbur.org/news/2016/12/13/boston-police-social-media-monitoring-opposition" target="_blank">sent a letter</a> to the mayor and city council calling for them to halt the plan. In coordination with the Massachusetts chapter of the ACLU, they also collected thousands of signatures on <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/boston-police-want-14-million-to-buy-social-media-monitoring-software-2" target="_blank">a petition</a> from Bostonians opposed to the deal. </p><p>When the Boston Globe issued a misguided endorsement of the BPD plan, Greer wrote <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/58480bf6e4b0ca53e4b9c1ec?timestamp=1481117010651" target="_blank">a rebuttal</a>, which was widely shared. BPD drew even <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/letters/2017/01/05/boston-police-should-blocked-from-buying-new-surveillance-tools/ssyPDkqPBpUsZSb39MY2IK/story.html" target="_blank">more criticism</a> on the plan when it was revealed that they had bent the rules in the Boston Trust Act in order to hand over at least 9 people to federal immigration officials for deportation, violating a city policy preventing cops from getting involved in immigration enforcement.</p><p>“City governments and law enforcement agencies around the country should take note of what happened here in Boston. The public will not allow them to waste our tax dollars on dangerous tools that won’t make us safer but will enable mass discrimination and violations of our rights,” Greer added.</p><p>###</p><p><i>Fight for the Future is a digital rights nonprofit best known for organizing the largest online protests in history against SOPA, for net neutrality, and against government surveillance.

Chelsea won’t survive another 5 years in prison, much less another 30. President Obama has 9 days to do the right thing and commute her sentence. The world is watching, and we hope that he stands on the side of justice, and that his legacy will be one of standing up for trans people’s rights, not having extinguished one of our community’s brightest lights.”</p><p><b>Chelsea’s Appellate Counsels Nancy Hollander and Vincent Ward said:</b></p><p>“As Chelsea&rsquo;s appellate counsel we urge President Obama to act now and commute her sentence to time served.

Photos by Lilia Villa as well.</i></p><p>We call on all Internet users to educate themselves, <b><a href="http://www.ocetisakowincamp.org/" target="_blank">get involved</a>,</b> and help spread the word about what is happening in North Dakota at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation.<br/></p><p>Native Americans who are speaking out have been brutally attacked and placed under extreme surveillance by the U.S. government. Most recently a young woman was severely injured and may lose her arm after police fired concussion grenades into a crowd. [1] We fight to defend the Internet for exactly these moments&ndash;when human rights are being trampled and the world needs to pay attention.</p><p>The Army Corps of Engineers <a href="http://bismarcktribune.com/news/state-and-regional/people-delivering-supplies-to-protest-camp-could-get-fine/article_9b017156-f1c2-5f02-9261-d2821c1fdfbe.html" target="_blank">has issued</a> an eviction notice to the Standing Rock water protectors, claiming they will not have permission to camp there after December 5th. A spokesperson for the Morton County Sheriff’s department has said that if they stay, &ldquo;they have to live with the consequences of potentially freezing to death.&rdquo; They have also warned that those delivering supplies could face up to a $1k fine. We can only assume the human rights situation will worsen if the government moves ahead with this plan.</p><p>As you read this, Dakota Access Pipeline, LLC, is knowingly plowing through sacred sites, burial grounds, and preparing to drill under the river without a permit &ndash; threatening the water supply of nearly 18 million Americans and the nation’s largest aquifer [2] &ndash; all with what appears to be full support from both state and federal authorities.  </p><p>Water Protectors, as the #NoDAPL movement has asked to be called, continue to be brutalized with excessive militarized force while praying peacefully in opposition.[3] Major news networks have failed to cover the story on television, making social media instrumental in helping indigenous people share the continued oppression and human rights violations as they play out in real time on Facebook Live - feeding the growing resistance in solidarity that’s now become an international movement.  </p><figure data-orig-width="5184" data-orig-height="3456" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/2eb44b7e7aa5f602fd33d62a8e483eed/tumblr_inline_ohoip1P0cM1ri3xd7_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="5184" data-orig-height="3456"/></figure><p>It’s a big deal. Over 300 indigenous tribes from across the US and around the world have converged along with thousands of allies for what many have called “the largest, most diverse tribal action in at least a century, perhaps since Little Bighorn.” [4] </p><p>While technology has helped them tell their story and find support, even more powerful people and institutions are using technology to conduct indiscriminate surveillance and suppression of free speech. </p><p>You may have noticed your Facebook timeline erupting with what seemed like friends traveling and “checking in” to the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota in the last few weeks. According to a viral post, the flood of check-ins was intended to “overwhelm and confuse” police agencies, saying that the Morton County Sheriff’s Department had been using check-ins to identify and “target” water protectors. [5]</p><figure data-orig-width="5184" data-orig-height="3456" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/90efeb8f5992c33cb5c78c1f962bda80/tumblr_inline_ohoipmAM7e1ri3xd7_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="5184" data-orig-height="3456"/></figure><p>Law enforcement and private DAPL security have maced, tear gassed, shot rubber bullets, exploded CS (tear gas) grenades, sprayed water cannons in sub-zero temperatures, and released attack dogs on water protectors. They have arrested hundreds so far, targeting indigenous people and leaders, and even caged some in dog kennels [6]&ndash; all for praying to defend their land and their drinking water. Both the UN and Amnesty International are now monitoring the human rights abuses happening at Standing Rock as public outrage keeps growing.</p><p>With more than 1.5 million check-ins, it was probably the largest counter-surveillance action ever taken. </p><p>Putting aside the effectiveness of it, the Facebook users that checked in at Standing Rock water protector camps believed they were creating cover for activists who were actually there, and whose social media presence was being monitored by law enforcement. That means over 1.5 million people worked together to protect indigenous people, and to evade the ubiquitous surveillance of our social networks by law enforcement. That is huge. </p><figure data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="2268" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/0bf1b42e4b35f9ed4b707e8341979807/tumblr_inline_ohoipyQ4sB1ri3xd7_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="4032" data-orig-height="2268"/></figure><p>But law enforcement has been doing more than just following social media posts. Signs of illegal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSI-catcher" target="_blank">IMSI catcher</a> intrusion, or &ldquo;stingrays,&rdquo; and other surveillance tactics have been reported on the ground. Cell phone communications and video live feeds have been disrupted, often at critical times when law enforcement attacks on the water protectors are most intense. </p><p>“People have reported having their phones misbehaving in odd ways. Batteries dying without warning are the most common reports. But there are creepier incidence, like FaceTime turning on by itself, voice recorders activating, apps malfunctioning, browsers seizing, messages disappearing, and strange noises during calls. My iPhone reset itself as if brand new from the box in my first week at Standing Rock.&ldquo; [7]</p><p>On October 20, the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) and the ACLU submitted FOIA and Open Records Requests to investigate the possible use of unconstitutional surveillance at Standing Rock. [8] In the press release, they noted that “Water Protectors and allies have been continuously surveilled by low-flying planes, helicopters, and drones, and have had local cell phone communications jammed and possibly recorded.” </p><p>What is happening at Standing Rock is an unprecedented crisis, and we are all witness to it. It is inexcusable to have, on American soil, a racist policy being enforced with police brutality, censorship, human rights abuses, and to have silence from our elected officials in response. Also, climate change is real, it threatens all of us, and actions to slow and stop fossil fuel infrastructure—while the world transitions to solar energy—are the front lines of the fight.</p><figure data-orig-width="5184" data-orig-height="3456" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/e0518920adf1d7af956c9066271ea7d5/tumblr_inline_ohoiqkL4DD1ri3xd7_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="5184" data-orig-height="3456"/></figure><p>We stand in solidarity with the water protectors at Standing Rock and ask anyone who wants to support their efforts to visit the websites for <a href="http://www.ocetisakowincamp.org/" target="_blank">Oceti Sakowin Camp</a>, <a href="http://sacredstonecamp.org/" target="_blank">Sacred Stone Camp</a>, and the <a href="https://medichealercouncil.com/" target="_blank">Standing Rock Medic + Healer Council</a> to get involved in their efforts.

      <h1><a href="/news/2016-11-29-urgent-the-fbi-cia-and-other-law-enforcement/">URGENT: The FBI, CIA, and other law enforcement agencies get expanded powers to hack into your computer and phone on Thursday, December 1. Some senators are pushing legislation to stop them, but they need more senators to join them immediately.</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 10:20 EST on November 29, 2016</span>


        <p>Beginning at midnight on Thursday, December 1, 2016, anyone who uses a VPN, Tor browser, or other privacy protection tools can more easily get hacked by the government.<br/></p><p>The FBI and other law enforcement agencies are scheduled to get expanded powers to remotely access and search computers, phones, and storage devices in cases where people suspected of being “related” to a crime  use technological means to conceal their location. <br/></p><p>That is, unless Congress takes action to stop these hacking powers from taking effect. </p><p>Under current criminal procedure rules, if the FBI or any other agency wants to hack into your computer, they need to get a warrant from a federal judge located within your federal judicial district. Under a new <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/proposed-amendment-rule-41.pdf" target="_blank">amendment</a> to the rule that takes effect on Thursday, if you use encryption, disable location tracking, or have been a botnet victim, the FBI can get a warrant to hack you from any of the <a href="http://www.fedbar.org/PDFs/A-Guide-to-the-Federal-Magistrate-Judge-System.aspx?FT=.pdf" target="_blank">more than 500</a> federal magistrate judges around the country. </p><p>So, if the FBI wants to hack you but they don’t have evidence that passes muster with your local federal judge, they will be able to take their case to a more lenient (or more naïve) judge located anywhere in the country. </p><p>Another clause in the rule change would let any federal judge authorize hacking operations for multiple devices in cases involving the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. That means if you are a victim of a botnet or had your computer infected by some malware, the government could remotely hack you under a mass hacking warrant issued by any federal judge. </p><p>The rule change was never voted on—or even debated—by Congress. It comes from the Judicial Conference, the national policy-making body for the federal courts, which earlier in the year agreed to a FBI proposal to amend Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCrmP) so they could get warrants to hack multiple computers in different districts. The Judicial Conference has authority to make technical changes to the rules governing criminal proceedings, but this proposal goes way beyond mere technicalities and should be subject to public and legislative debate.  </p><p><b>We don’t have much time, but we can still stop the government from getting these new mass hacking powers. <b><a href="http://www.decidethefuture.org/" target="_blank"><b>Dial 1-919-FREEDOM or use this page to get connected with your senators</b></a>.</b><br/></b></p><p>A bipartisan group of senators and representatives is pushing legislation to block the Judicial Conference’s amendment or at least delay it for a few months so Congress can hold a debate. They will be bringing their bills to the floor for unanimous consent consideration on Tuesday and Wednesday. If no senators object, the bills could pass. </p><p>While Congress is unlikely to approve the bill to fully block the rule change (the so-called “<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5321" target="_blank">Stop Mass Hacking Act</a>”) they could possibly be convinced to pass a bill from Senator Chris Coons to <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/3475?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22coons%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1" target="_blank">delay it until July 1, 2017</a>.</p><p>According to strategists on the Hill, the best approach at this late stage is to get the Senate to pass the bill first and then use that as pressure to urge the House to follow suit &ndash; ideally before the rule change takes effect on Thursday, but they could also pass it at a later date and have the rule change repealed. </p><p><b>The best thing you can do to stop the hacking rule is to call your senators and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to ask them to delay the rule change. <a href="http://www.decidethefuture.org/" target="_blank"><b>Dial 1-919-FREEDOM or use this page to get connected with your senators</b></a>.</b></p><p><b>After you call your senators, make an extra call to Majority Leader McConnell and urge him to agree to unanimous consent on delaying the Rule 41 change. You can reach him at (202) 224-2541.<br/></b></p><p>Here’s what you should say when you call your senators:</p><p><i>“I am a constituent from [town or city] and I am calling to urge the Senator to agree to unanimous consent on legislation to delay the Rule 41 changes on warrant requirements for government hacking of people’s computers. This rule change could have a big impact on the privacy of all Americans and it should be debated by Congress before going into effect.”</i></p><p>You can find your senators’ numbers below. <br/></p><p><b>Alabama</b></p><p>Jeff Sessions  (202) 224-4124</p><p>Richard Shelby  (202) 224-5744</p><p><b>Alaska</b></p><p>Lisa Murkowski  (202) 224-6665</p><p>Daniel Sullivan  (202) 224-3004</p><p><b>Arizona </b></p><p>Jeff Flake  (202) 224-4521</p><p>John McCain  (202) 224-2235</p><p><b>Arkansas</b></p><p>John Boozman  (202) 224-4843</p><p>Tom Cotton  (202) 224-2353</p><p><b>California</b></p><p>Barbara Boxer  (202) 224-3553</p><p>Dianne Feinstein  (202) 224-3841</p><p><b>Colorado</b></p><p>Michael Bennet  (202) 224-5852</p><p>Cory Gardner  (202) 224-5941</p><p><b>Connecticut</b></p><p>Richard Blumenthal  (202) 224-2823</p><p>Chris Murphy  (202) 224-4041</p><p><b>Delaware</b></p><p>Tom Carper  (202) 224-2441</p><p>Chris Coons  (202) 224-5042</p><p><b>Florida</b></p><p>Bill Nelson  (202) 224-5274</p><p>Marco Rubio  (202) 224-3041</p><p><b>Georgia</b></p><p>Johnny Isakson  (202) 224-3643</p><p>David Perdue  (202) 224-3521</p><p><b>Hawaii</b></p><p>Mazie Hirono  (202) 224-6361</p><p>Brian Schatz  (202) 224-3934</p><p><b>Idaho</b></p><p>Mike Crapo  (202) 224-6142</p><p>James Risch  (202) 224-2752</p><p><b>Illinois</b></p><p>Dick Durbin  (202) 224-2152</p><p>Mark Kirk  (202) 224-2854</p><p><b>Indiana</b></p><p>Daniel Coats  (202) 224-5623</p><p>Joe Donnelly  (202) 224-4814</p><p><b>Iowa</b></p><p>Joni Ernst  (202) 224-3254</p><p>Chuck Grassley  (202) 224-3744</p><p><b>Kansas</b></p><p>Jerry Moran  (202) 224-6521</p><p>Pat Roberts  (202) 224-4774</p><p><b>Kentucky</b></p><p>Mitch McConnell  (202) 224-2541</p><p>Rand Paul  (202) 224-4343</p><p><b>Louisiana</b></p><p>Bill Cassidy  (202) 224-5824</p><p>David Vitter  (202) 224-4623</p><p><b>Maine</b></p><p>Susan Collins  (202) 224-2523</p><p>Angus King  (202) 224-5344</p><p><b>Maryland</b></p><p>Ben Cardin  (202) 224-4524</p><p>Barbara Mikulski  (202) 224-4654</p><p><b>Massachusetts</b></p><p>Elizabeth Warren  (202) 224-4543</p><p>Ed Markey  (202) 224-2742</p><p><b>Michigan</b></p><p>Gary Peters  (202) 224-6221</p><p>Debbie Stabenow  (202) 224-4822</p><p><b>Minnesota</b></p><p>Al Franken  (202) 224-5641</p><p>Amy Klobuchar  (202) 224-3244</p><p><b>Mississippi</b></p><p>Roger Wicker  (202) 224-6253</p><p>Thad Cochran  (202) 224-5054</p><p><b>Missouri</b></p><p>Roy Blunt  (202) 224-5721</p><p>Claire McCaskill  (202) 224-6154</p><p><b>Montana</b></p><p>Steve Daines  (202) 224-2651</p><p>Jon Tester  (202) 224-2644</p><p><b>Nebraska</b></p><p>Deb Fischer  (202) 224-6551</p><p>Ben Sasse  (202) 224-4224</p><p><b>Nevada</b></p><p>Harry Reid  (202) 224-3542</p><p>Dean Heller  (202) 224-6244</p><p><b>New Hampshire</b></p><p>Kelly Ayotte  (202) 224-3324</p><p>Jean Shaheen  (202) 224-2841</p><p><b>New Jersey</b></p><p>Cory Booker  (202) 224-3224</p><p>Robert Menendez  (202) 224-4744</p><p><b>New Mexico</b></p><p>Martin Heinrich  (202) 224-5521</p><p>Tom Udall  (202) 224-6621</p><p><b>New York</b></p><p>Kirsten Gillibrand  (202) 224-4451</p><p>Chuck Schumer  (202) 224-6542</p><p><b>North Carolina</b></p><p>Thom Tillis  (202) 224-6342</p><p>Richard Burr  (202) 224-3154</p><p><b>North Dakota</b></p><p>Heidi Heitkamp  (202) 224-2043</p><p>John Hoeven  (202) 224-2551</p><p><b>Ohio</b></p><p>Sherrod Brown  (202) 224-2315</p><p>Rob Portman  (202) 224-3353</p><p><b>Oklahoma</b></p><p>Jim Inhofe  (202) 224-4721</p><p>James Lankford  (202) 224-5754</p><p><b>Oregon</b></p><p>Jeff Merkley  (202) 224-3753</p><p>Ron Wyden  (202) 224-5244</p><p><b>Pennsylvania</b></p><p>Bob Casey  (202) 224-6324</p><p>Pat Toomey  (202) 224-4254</p><p><b>Rhode Island</b></p><p>Jack Reed  (202) 224-4642</p><p>Sheldon Whitehouse  (202) 224-2921</p><p><b>South Carolina</b></p><p>Lindsey Graham  (202) 224-5972</p><p>Tim Scott  (202) 224-6121</p><p><b>South Dakota</b></p><p>Mike Rounds  (202) 224-5842</p><p>John Thune  (202) 224-2321</p><p><b>Tennessee</b></p><p>Lamar Alexander  (202) 224-4944</p><p>Bob Corker  (202) 224-3344</p><p><b>Texas</b></p><p>John Cornyn  (202) 224-2934</p><p>Ted Cruz  (202) 224-5922</p><p><b>Utah</b></p><p>Orrin Hatch  (202) 224-5251</p><p>Mike Lee  (202) 224-5444</p><p><b>Vermont</b></p><p>Pat Leahy  (202) 224-4242</p><p>Bernie Sanders  (202) 224-5141</p><p><b>Virginia</b></p><p>Tim Kaine  (202) 224-4024</p><p>Mark Warner  (202) 224-2023</p><p><b>Washington</b></p><p>Maria Cantwell  (202) 224-3441</p><p>Patty Murray (202) 224-2621</p><p><b>West Virginia</b></p><p>Shelley Moore Capito  (202) 224-6472</p><p>Joe Manchin  (202) 224-3954</p><p><b>Wisconsin</b></p><p>Tammy Baldwin  (202) 224-5653</p><p>Ron Johnson  (202) 224-5323</p><p><b>Wyoming</b></p><p>John Barrasso  (202) 224-6441</p><p>Mike Enzi  (202) 224-3424</p>
