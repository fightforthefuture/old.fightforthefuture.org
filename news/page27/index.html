<p><span>You’re going to like this. </span><strong><a href="http://callcomcast.org" target="_blank">We just built a new tool in the fight for net neutrality. Check it out!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Have you ever had a super frustrating situation with your Cable company &ndash; over your bill, their crappy service, slow connection, or whatever&ndash;and gotten upset with the customer service representative on the phone?</span></p>
<p><span>Hey, we’ve all been there. But the reality is those underpaid call center employees aren’t the ones to blame for your Cable bill catastrophe or that slow loading pinwheel on the video you want to stream.</span></p>
<p><span>Comcast’s top executives and lobbyists are laughing all the way to the bank while they make your Internet slow and keep your Cable bill sky high. Worse, they’re spreading blatant lies about net neutrality and throwing around millions of dollars in campaign contributions to buy off Congress and protect their monopoly power.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://callcomcast.org" target="_blank">These are the people who are to blame. And we found their phone numbers and email addresses. Click here to put all your frustration to good use and tell Comcast to stop lying.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Comcast has millions to spend on lobbying and and they can blanket Washington, DC in misleading ads. The public has a right to call and demand that they stop their campaign of deceit &ndash; and every minute that Comcast’s lobbyists spend on the phone with you is a minute they’re not spending trying to kill net neutrality.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://callcomcast.org" target="_blank">Think about it. Now click here to call a Comcast lobbyist!</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Thanks team! More soon.<br/>-Jeff at Fight for the Future</span><br/><br/><span>P.S.

<p><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><span>Look, you don’t have time to read a long email, and I don’t have time to write one so I’ll get right to the point:</span><span> we are just $20,000 short of our year-end fundraising goal, and there’s still 48 hours left. </span><span>Can you help us close the gap so we don’t have to scale back our campaigns in the New Year?</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/?tag=yearend2014version1" target="_blank">Please click here help us keep winning in 2015.</a></strong></p>

<p><span>2015 will be critical year in the battle over the future of the Internet. </span><span>We’re doing the math right now and we know if we start off the New Year low on funds, we’re going to have to make tough choices about what to work on.</span><span> The Trans-Pacific Partnership, the revival of CISPA, net neutrality, the MPAA’s latest attempt at SOPA, our ongoing work to end mass surveillance. Every single one of these campaigns is essential to the future of the web. Failure is not an option. </span><span>That’s why we’re asking for your help again.</span></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-316bb5f9-5ec7-ff5e-6378-225a3f253277"><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><span>“Rectal feeding.” Wrongfully detained prisoners forced to stand on broken legs. Deaths from hypothermia. People missing. By now you’ve surely read the gruesome details from the CIA Torture Report. [1] Incredibly, the only person who is in jail as a result of this illegal program (and coverup) is &hellip; the whistleblower who exposed it. [2]</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/pardonjohn" target="_blank">Sign the petition to pardon John Kiriakou, the CIA agent that exposed the torture program.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>As a CIA agent, John Kiriakou was ordered to commit inhumane acts of torture, but he refused. [3] He did what all of us would like to think we would do in that situation. Now the government is punishing him for doing the right thing.</span></p>
<p><span>In times like these, it’s critical we all stand up and hold our government accountable. We can start by gaining freedom for the person who helped shed light on these crimes. Then we can begin prosecuting the real perpetrators: the politicians who authorized this torture, and the CIA officials who hid it from the Senate and the public.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/pardonjohn" target="_blank">Click here to sign the petition to free John Kiriakou, the CIA torture report whistle blower.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>Anytime the government cracks down on whistleblowers and those who tell the truth, all of our rights are undermined. Let’s stand up for John and stand up for the things we can all believe in: transparency and justice.</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely,<br/>-Tiffiniy, Holmes, Kevin, Evan, and Jeff at FFTF</span></p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2014-12-17-why-is-sunlight-foundation-playing-into-american">Why is Sunlight Foundation playing into American Commitment’s scam?</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 18:26 EST on December 17, 2014</span>


        <p id="docs-internal-guid-bebf073e-5a91-1cb0-49a9-616e0f8ae9c7"><span>The Sunlight Foundation today published </span><a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2014/12/17/clearing-up-the-confusion-about-our-analysis-of-net-neutrality-comments-to-the-fcc/" target="_blank"><span>a post</span></a><span> defending their claim that anti-net neutrality activists “dominated” the second round of the FCC’s Open Internet proceeding, based on data released by the FCC. However, numerous problems with the data and their methodology make it impossible to support their conclusions. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>There were three huge problems. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>First, we know the data Sunlight used excluded many of our comments. Today we confirmed with the FCC that at least 244,000 pro-net neutrality comments were not processed correctly due to an error on their end, and were missing from the data they released to Sunlight. </span><strong>This alone is enough to tip the scales in favor of net neutrality activists, if going purely by the numbers, and it could be much higher. [1]</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>Second, the Sunlight Foundation knew it was missing over 800,000 comments, and they didn’t try to figure out if the data they analysed was a representative sample. The group that “dominated” the second round of comments (in Sunlight’s words) could have simply been the one organization that–due to the technique it used for submitting–didn’t get all its submissions garbled. In fact, it looks like that’s what happened. American Commitment’s </span><a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-conservative-anti-net-neutrality-movement-that-wasnt" target="_blank"><span>own reported numbers</span></a><span> are actually a little </span><span>lower</span><span> than their total in Sunlight’s report (probably due to a final burst of paid advertising before the deadline). </span><strong>Pro-net neutrality comments got lost. Anti-net neutrality comments didn’t. The sample wasn’t representative of the whole.</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>The third problem in Sunlight’s report is their methodology, as they themselves describe it. Sunlight has publicly acknowledged a huge difference in how they counted some comments from pro-net neutrality groups like Free Press versus comments from American Commitment, the one (</span><a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-conservative-anti-net-neutrality-movement-that-wasnt" target="_blank"><span>shady</span></a><span>) anti-net neutrality group.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>All groups were effectively collecting signatures on a letter. American Commitment submitted them as a barrage of identical comments, while groups like Free Press submitted them as signatures on a single letter. The FCC says it recognizes and counts both. But Sunlight Foundation admits they chose to treat them differently, excluding multiple signatures on a single letter from the count.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>

<p><span>We can’t see any basis for this, other than convenience. In both cases, an individual member of the American public is taking a moment to say “Hey FCC: I agree with the following statement.” It just happens that two groups submitted that sentiment in different ways. It would be one thing if the FCC treated such comments differently, but they don’t! The FCC has said signatures count the same as individual comments. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>Sunlight expresses it in neutral tones, saying “This isn’t to suggest that signature-only submissions shouldn’t be counted, but the focus of our report meant that we discarded them.” The thing is, that’s an arbitrary choice, at odds with both the intent of the people who commented </span><span>and</span><span> the FCC’s own criteria. And it has a huge impact on the results!</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>By making this choice, Sunlight knows they are excluding many pro-net neutrality comments while including *every* anti-net neutrality comment from American Commitment. <span>In other words, they know their sample is skewed.</span></strong></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>Finally, we’re bothered by how Sunlight handled the correction. Our CTO was up all night with the FCC data they used, comparing it to ours, and found some serious issues. We told them this. We urged them to work with us today to figure out what went wrong. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>Instead, they worked on a response in silence, simply justifying their work without examining their exclusion of signatures. This would be bad even if American Commitment </span><span>wasn’t</span><span> engaged in a cynical attempt to manipulate the public conversation around an extremely important issue. But they are. </span><a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-conservative-anti-net-neutrality-movement-that-wasnt" target="_blank"><span>Read about it</span></a><span>. Sunlight knows this context, but instead of approaching the data carefully and working with others to get the answer right, they’re playing right into the scam. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>The headline of their first post was (and remains at the time of writing) “One group dominates the second round of net neutrality comments.” If you arbitrarily ignore a subset of commenters (the signers) and base your conclusions on data everyone agrees is incomplete and broken, that’s true. The problem is, their provocative headline doesn’t include that disclaimer. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>We still hope Sunlight will do the right thing, acknowledge the mistakes they and the FCC made and correct the record. That headline is the first thing they should fix.</span></p>

<p><br/><span>[1] </span><strong>A note on duplicates: </strong><span>Sunlight writes that, of the limited number of comments from Battle for the Net that actually made it into the FCC’s data, many were duplicates and thus excluded from the study. We verified that we sent at least 526,657 unique CSV comments to the FCC by examining reference numbers we attached to them. Today the FCC acknowledged that there were technical problems with their ability to process the CSVs, and they are missing at least 244,000 pro-net neutrality comments from Battle for the Net. </span><strong>If the comments that actually made it into Sunlight’s data were duplicates of one another, then the number of comments the FCC lost or garbled in its release is even greater than the 244,000 confirmed so far.</strong></p>

      <h1><a href="/news/2014-12-17-nothing-is-impossible">Nothing is impossible.</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 14:53 EST on December 17, 2014</span>


        <p><a href="https://donate.fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank"><span><span><img src="//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_ngqsl6JlNE1ri3xd7.jpg"/></span></span></a></p>

<p><span>Dear Fight for the Future member,</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve got to be honest with you. I really didn’t think we would make it this far. </span></p>
<p><span>When we started this fight for net neutrality, it seemed like the odds were stacked impossibly against us. We’re up against some of the most powerful and politically well-connected companies in the world. Companies that are so close to the government, sometimes it’s hard to tell the two apart. </span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://list.fightforthefuture.org/mpss/c/2AA/ZgwNAA/t.1iw/IwRHE1YURqCJw0xySamMew/h0/Xxtw1HhmfjtZ771WJVHAYfbi0Z2bBvfnSDEQ1-2FYV5r05a60tJf1ZM-2BP298okq8Oo" target="_blank">But against all odds, we are winning. Everything we are hearing says the FCC is finally caving to the public pressure and writing a real net neutrality rule. Please help us finish the fight: click here to chip in whatever you can afford today.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>To tell the truth, when we first started this, there was a pretty strong voice in the back of my mind telling me we couldn’t win. It seemed like one of those fights you just had to fight because it was the only righteous, just, rational thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span>But here at Fight for the Future, when we take on a campaign, we fight to win, whether the goal seems “possible” or not. So we went all in, and spent long nights and hard days just making stuff happen. Stuff like Occupy the FCC, the Internet Slowdown, a giant net neutrality video billboard, and a calling campaign that’s kept dozens of phones at the FCC, Congress, and the White House ringing off the hook for months. </span></p>
<p><span>It’s working, and the effects are measurable. But the next two months will be crucial. The closer we get to winning a real net neutrality rule, the more desperate and aggressive Comcast and Verizon’s lobbyists become. </span><span>They’re pouring tons of money into a misleading Ad campaign right now that’s blanketing Washington, DC in a last ditch effort to sink net neutrality in Congress, just when it seems we’ve finally secured it.</span><span> But we have something they don’t have. We have all of you!</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://list.fightforthefuture.org/mpss/c/2AA/ZgwNAA/t.1iw/IwRHE1YURqCJw0xySamMew/h1/Xxtw1HhmfjtZ771WJVHAYfbi0Z2bBvfnSDEQ1-2FYV5r05a60tJf1ZM-2BP298okq8Oo" target="_blank">Click here to chip in $20 (or whatever you can afford) to help us counter Comcast’s lies and win the fight for net neutrality.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>We’re running a little low on funds for our net neutrality work right now, but here’s the plan. </span><span>There are 1.2 </span><span>million</span><span> people on this email list. If everyone gives $1 right now, we could run our own Ad campaign that would tear Comcast’s lies to shreds, </span><span>and connect it to our broader strategy pressuring lawmakers with innovative online actions and tried and true on-the-ground protest tactics. </span></p>
<p><span>But not everyone can give $1, so some of us have to give $20, or $50 or $500! This is history in the making. Let’s all chip in whatever we can.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://list.fightforthefuture.org/mpss/c/2AA/ZgwNAA/t.1iw/IwRHE1YURqCJw0xySamMew/h2/Xxtw1HhmfjtZ771WJVHAYfbi0Z2bBvfnSDEQ1-2FYV5r05a60tJf1ZM-2BP298okq8Oo" target="_blank">Yes, I can chip in something to make sure we win the last round of the net neutrality fight.</a></strong></p>
<p><span>If there’s one thing we’ve learned since our epic victory against SOPA, it’s that the Internet has completely changed what is and isn’t possible when it comes to politics. Thanks to the free and open web, our tiny team of 7 people has been able to go head to head some of the best funded lobbying operations in the world, and win.</span></p>
<p><span>I really never thought I would get to send this email. We still have a long way to go, and we’ll need your support for the final round. But there’s one thing I’m sure of now. As long as we keep the Internet free and open: </span><span>nothing is impossible.</span></p>

<p><span>Yours for the Internet,<br/>-Evan at FFTF</span> </p>
<p><span>P.S. If you have nothing to give, that&rsquo;s no problem. Just give yourself a pat on the back for being part of a movement that is winning. We&rsquo;re glad to have you on the team.</span></p>
