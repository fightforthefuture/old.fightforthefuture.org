      <h1><a href="/news/2015-10-19-yelp-and-wikipedia-join-growing-list-of-companies/">Yelp and Wikipedia join growing list of companies opposing CISA, controversial cybersecurity bill</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 00:56 EDT on October 19, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>October 19, 2015</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, press@fightforthefuture.org</p><p>Over the weekend, Yelp and the Wikimedia Foundation (who run Wikipedia, the 7th most popular website in the world) joined a growing list of tech companies opposing the the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA).<br/></p><p>Yelp, the popular online review site<a href="https://twitter.com/Yelp/status/655938689952976896" target="_blank"> <b>tweeted its opposition</b></a><b> </b>last night, saying: “Congress is trying to pass a &ldquo;cyber security&rdquo; bill that threatens your privacy. Join us &amp; others to oppose,” linking to Fight for the Future’s campaign site CISPAisBack.org</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="193" data-orig-width="537"><img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/d3f6aa707238d29b01533ef7832389bf/tumblr_inline_nwgb0jbjDI1ri3xd7_540.png" data-orig-height="193" data-orig-width="537"/></figure><p>Wikimedia added their voice on Friday, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/wikimediapolicy/status/655179547994816512" target="_blank">tweeting</a>,</b> “We believe in fighting for our users privacy and security. That’s why we oppose #CISA, a bill that endangers both.”  </p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="248" data-orig-width="550"><img src="https://40.media.tumblr.com/f654ea22453c3c84d9ec3503d0c76c7d/tumblr_inline_nwgayiL8Ci1ri3xd7_540.png" data-orig-height="248" data-orig-width="550"/></figure><p>Yelp and Wikimedia are in good company opposing the bill. Dozens of cybersecurity experts have weighed in, saying the legislation not only threatens privacy but would fail to address the fundamental issues causing cyber attacks and breaches. Last week, CCIA, an industry association representing tech giants Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Amazon, T-Mobile, Sprint, and others, also <b><a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/131222608488/breaking-trade-group-representing-google" target="_blank">issued a statement</a> </b>slamming the bill. </p><p>“It’s awesome to see Yelp and other companies weighing in on the side of Team Internet once again,” said Fight for the Future co-founder Tiffiniy Cheng. “By opposing CISA they’re standing up for their users’ privacy and security, and showing the way for other companies to do the same.” </p><p>Mozilla, reddit, imgur, Wordpress, Craigslist, Namecheap, and hundreds of other companies have opposed CISA and <b><a href="http://cispaisback.org" target="_blank">similar</a> </b>information sharing legislation in the past.</p><p>Last month, the Business Software Alliance, which represents Apple, Microsoft, and other major tech companies, clarified that <a href="http://www.bsa.org/policy/security" target="_blank"><b>it does not support</b></a> any of the three information sharing bills before Congress after Fight for the Future ran<b> <a href="http://youbetrayedus.org" target="_blank">a public campaign</a></b> called YouBetrayedUs that spurred a flurry of angry emails from consumers targeting companies that signed a BSA letter that appeared to support CISA. </p><p>CISA’s sponsors have repeatedly claimed that the bill will see the senate floor this week, but given this latest revolt from the tech industry, many watching the bill are skeptical of it moving quickly anytime soon.</p><p>###</p>

        <span class="date">Posted 11:05 EDT on October 15, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>October 15, 2015</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-,6457, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a></p><p>This morning, the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), a trade group that represents many large technology companies including Google, Facebook, and Yahoo, <a href="http://www.ccianet.org/2015/10/ccia-urges-senate-to-improve-cybersecurity-information-sharing-act/" target="_blank">published a blog post</a> saying they do not support the current version of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA.)<br/></p><p>“[CISA] does not sufficiently protect users’ privacy or appropriately limit the permissible uses of information shared with the government,” the post read, “In addition, the bill authorizes entities to employ network defense measures that might cause collateral harm to the systems of innocent third parties &hellip;  such a system should not come at the expense of users’ privacy, need not be used for purposes unrelated to cybersecurity, and must not enable activities that might actively destabilize the infrastructure the bill aims to protect.”</p><p>CCIA <a href="http://www.ccianet.org/about/members/" target="_blank">represents</a> a wide range of large technology companies including: Amazon, British Telecom, Cloudflare, Dish, eBay, Facebook, Foursquare, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Pandora, Paypal, Samsung, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Yahoo.</p><p>“Internet users are outraged that Congress is even considering legislation that undermines the basic security of the Internet by sweeping away privacy protections and letting companies off the hook when they improperly share or leak our personal information,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future,</b> “Members of Congress should pay attention: nobody wants this bill. Not the public, not security experts, and not even the industry it’s supposed to protect. The safety of Internet users personal information is more fragile than ever, if Congress decides to make matters worse, everyone will know it was the result of ignorance and corruption”</p><p>This new host of companies coming out against the current version of CISA is a major blow to the already teetering legislation. It is particularly notable that T-Mobile is a member of CCIA, as the sponsors of CISA have attempted to use the recent <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/130360813438/fight-for-the-future-calls-for-experian-ceo-to" target="_blank">T-Mobile / Experian</a> information breach as an excuse to push the bill to the Senate floor, even though cybersecurity <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20151008/17085132483/why-do-senators-keep-lying-about-what-cisa-would-be-used.shtml" target="_blank">experts say</a> CISA would have done nothing to prevent it. </p><p>Last month, the Business Software Alliance, which represents Apple, Adobe, Microsoft, Salesforce, and others, clarified that <a href="http://www.bsa.org/policy/security" target="_blank">it does not support CISA</a> after Fight for the Future launched a campaign calling out companies that had <a href="http://www.bsa.org/~/media/Files/Policy/Data/09142015CongLeadershipDataAgendaLetter.pdf" target="_blank">signed a letter</a> that appeared to support CISA-like legislation. </p><p>The <a href="http://youbetrayedus.org" target="_blank">YouBetrayedUs.org</a> campaign sparked a major backlash from customers and Internet users, generating thousands of emails to the companies involved, and online calls for a boycott, which quickly lead to Salesforce’s CEO <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/129854286868/breaking-facing-public-backlash-salesforce-ceo" target="_blank">taking to twitter</a> to say that his company does not support the bill and the original BSA letter was “a mistake.”</p><p>Technology companies and members of Congress are under increasing pressure to oppose CISA, which has now been delayed multiple times in the Senate after grassroots uprisings. Fight for the Future and other groups are planning to escalate their efforts targeting both Congress and technology companies that remain silent or support CISA, and will be ready if the bill comes before the Senate in the coming weeks.</p><p>###</p>

It should have been obvious to anyone observing the process that this would be the result.  Appointed government bureaucrats and monopolistic companies were given more access to the text than elected officials and journalists; from the outset there was no way this was going to be a good deal for the public&rdquo;</i></p><p><i>&ldquo;Honestly, at this point, the only true course of action for members of Congress who still believe in democracy would be to completely defund and do away with the office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR,) who are largely responsible for the TPP and its extremist contents. This agency become the laughing stock of Washington, DC and is one of the most blatant examples of a revolving door between industry and government. The contents of the TPP&rsquo;s IP chapter were bought and paid for by Hollywood and the pharmaceutical industry before the negotiations even began.</i></p><p><i>The U.S.’s copyright system is corrupt and severely broken. But instead of trying to fix it, the USTR is trying to force these draconian policies on the rest of the world.

        <span class="date">Posted 12:10 EDT on October 5, 2015</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>October 5, 2015</p><p>Contact: Evan Greer, 978-852-6457, press@fightforthefuture.org</p><p>This morning, government officials reported that the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement has been “finalized” after a weekend of closed-door meetings in Atlanta. <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>, a leading digital rights group that has opposed the deal due to its lack of transparency and extreme copyright provisions that could lead to Internet censorship, issued the following statement, which can be attributed to Campaign Director, Evan Greer:<br/></p><p><i>“Government bureaucrats have emerged from their secret meetings claiming they’ve finalized the TPP text, but it’s anything but a done deal. For the Trans-Pacific Partnership to become law, it must first be accepted by each individual country’s elected officials, including U.S. Congress, where it faces fierce resistance from both political parties.<br/><br/>The TPP is a wishlist for monopolistic corporations that inherently benefits giant multinational companies while undermining small businesses and startups. Based on the latest leaks, the TPP contains extreme copyright provisions that will stifle innovation, harm the tech economy, and worst of all, threaten our basic rights to self-expression by paving the way for widespread Internet censorship.<br/></i></p><p><i>The future of the Internet is far too important to be decided in an agreement that has been negotiated entirely behind closed doors. The public outcry is already rising, but in the coming weeks we will amplify it tenfold. The Internet has proven its ability to defend itself time and time again. U.S. lawmakers are in the spotlight now, and they should know that the public is watching them closely and overwhelmingly expects them to vote down this terrible deal.”</i></p><p>Fight for the Future is a digital rights nonprofit that has driven more than 130,000 emails and more than 15,000 phone calls to Congress in recent months, rallied more than 7,500 websites for an <a href="https://battleforthenet.com/internetvote" target="_blank">online protest</a>, and helped coordinate <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/20/hundreds-tech-companies-oppose-tpp-trade-agreement" target="_blank">a letter</a> to Congress from more than 250 tech companies expressing transparency and tech related concerns about Fast Track legislation.</p><p>The group made headlines in March when they <a href="http://cms.fightforthefuture.org/wydenblimp/" target="_blank">flew a 30’ blimp</a> over several of Senator Ron Wyden’s town hall meetings calling for him to “Save the Internet” by opposing Fast Track for the TPP, and then <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/115053188968/internet-activists-call-out-ron-wyden-over-fast" target="_blank">parked a Jumbotron</a> on capitol hill to display <a href="https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=923903510963109" target="_blank">the viral video</a> they made about the stunt.
