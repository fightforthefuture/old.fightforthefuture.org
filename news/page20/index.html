They crafted this bronze bust as ‘a gift to the city’, a memorial meant to spark conversations about issues central to our freedom.</p><p>Within hours, it was confiscated and turned over to the NYPD. [1]</p><p>But this morning, free speech advocates in NYC held a press conference to demand the confiscated Snowden bust be returned to the artists.</p><p><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/snowden-bust" target="_blank"><b>Sign the petition joining the call for the NYPD to return the Snowden statue.</b></a></p><p>A local gallery has already agreed to exhibit the work while the artists submit an application to legally install the sculpture through the New York City Parks Department. In other words, New York could soon have a permanent monument to the whistleblower who challenged NSA surveillance. But first we need to free the statue!</p><p>Snowden may still be in exile for exposing the NSA’s crimes, but we can honor his efforts to hold the US government accountable by making sure this artwork gets released. <b><a href="https://cms.fightforthefuture.org/snowden-bust" target="_blank">Sign the petition now, and share it widely</a>!</b></p><p>Thanks for all that you do,</p><p>-Susan, Evan, Holmes, Tiffiniy, Jessica, Vasjen, Charlie and Jeff<br/>Fight for the Future</p><p>P.S.

We think Internet users should have a voice anytime there’s a major decision that impacts our rights.</p><p><a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/internetvote/" target="_blank"><b>So we’re organizing an Internet-wide vote on April 23rd to stop “Fast Track” and give Internet users a voice. Will you join?</b></a></p><p>This is that do-or-die moment. But if we win, it won’t just slow down the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it will send a message to those in power that they can’t mess with the Internet.

      <h1><a href="/news/2015-04-07-proof-fcc-commissioner-ajit-pai-mislead-the">PROOF: FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai mislead the public in his official FCC statement</a></h1>

        <span class="date">Posted 12:54 EDT on April 7, 2015</span>


        <p><b>UPDATE: </b><i>After we posted the statement below on reddit,<a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2015/db0403/DOC-332846A1.pdf" target="_blank"> the FCC corrected</a> Ajit Pai’s statement to remove the false claim that Fight for the Future is a “government funded” group. </i></p><p>During FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai’s dissent against the new net neutrality rules, he presented false and misleading information about the support for net neutrality. He characterized one of the leading net neutrality advocacy groups as a government-funded group &ndash; even though we’ve never received a dollar from the government.</p><p><b>Full disclosure: </b>I’m Jessica Bruno, and I keep the books for Fight for the Future. We’re a pro-net neutrality group responsible for driving 777,364 pro-net neutrality comments to the FCC through the Battle for the Net campaign.</p><p>In his official, written testimony opposing net neutrality, Commissioner Pai called Fight for the Future a “government-funded group,” citing our 990 tax form as proof. But that form doesn&rsquo;t mean we take government money. If you look at page 9, right next to where it says, &ldquo;Government grants (contributions),&rdquo; there&rsquo;s a blank space indicating that we received $0 from the government.</p><p>The reason we filed a 990 is to be transparent about where we get our funding from. Most of it comes from small grants or donations from our 1.2 million members who overwhelmingly support net neutrality and donated to us to help make sure we could fight to protect it.</p><p>The full text of Commissioner Pai’s testimony is here: <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/article/fcc-15-24a5" target="_blank">http://www.fcc.gov/article/fcc-15-24a5</a></p><p>A screenshot of just the relevant text and citation is here: <a href="http://cl.ly/image/3u1A0m3y0H2a" target="_blank">http://cl.ly/image/3u1A0m3y0H2a</a>.</p><p>Our full 990 is available here: <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/images/990.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.battleforthenet.com/images/990.pdf</a></p>

If he turns his back on those values by supporting outdated and anti-democratic Fast Track legislation, his legacy will be forever tarnished. The film festival today was just one more reminder that the public is outraged that he’s even considering this deal, and if he cares about what his constituents have to say at all he will do the right thing.”</p><figure data-orig-width="3872" data-orig-height="2592"><img data-orig-width="3872" data-orig-height="2592" src="//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nm1izl7jXf1ri3xd7_540.jpg"/></figure><p>A few dozen people gathered on the National Mall to watch the film festival, snacking on free popcorn and enjoying several short videos including many sent directly from supporters and constituents who addressed Senator Wyden directly and asked him to do the right thing. The film fest kicked off with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=923903510963109" target="_blank">a viral video</a> of activists who followed the Senator around his home state of Oregon with a 30-foot blimp, which has already seen more than 160,000 views online. </p><p>Today’s event is the latest in an escalating series of online and offline protests focused on Senator Wyden. Last week, the Senator <a href="http://tumblr.fightforthefuture.org/post/114529025493/senator-ron-wyden-moves-dc-fundraising-dinner-at" target="_blank">moved a fundraising dinner</a> in Washington, DC at the last minute after Internet activist groups planned a protest outside. Last year, 25 tech companies including reddit, Namecheap, and Imgur sent a letter to Senator Wyden detailing their concerns with Fast Track. Online, activists have been pummeling the Senator with more than 35,000 tweets in recent weeks, and thousands of phone calls and emails.</p><p>The “Hey Ron Wyden! Film Festival” was organized by Fight for the Future, a digital rights group best known for their role in the massive protests against SOPA and in the recent fight for net neutrality.</p><figure data-orig-width="3872" data-orig-height="2592"><img data-orig-width="3872" data-orig-height="2592" src="//s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_nm1izz9IBD1ri3xd7_500.jpg"/></figure><p>###</p>
