        <span class="date">Posted 20:36 EDT on April 3, 2017</span>


        <p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, April 3, 2017<br/>Contact: Evan Greer, <a href="mailto:press@fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">press@fightforthefuture.org</a>, 978-852-6457</p><h2><i>Bill to let ISPs collect and sell customer information has generated massive backlash from Trump supporters and progressives alike</i></h2><p>Monday evening, President Donald Trump signed SR Res 34, a bill to slash the FCC’s Internet privacy rules and allow Internet Service Providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T to monitor, collect, and sell the details of their customers’ Internet activity to advertisers. The legislation was passed by Congress last week, amid massive public backlash from across the political spectrum, <b><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/reddit-the-donald-internet-privacy-crisis/?tw=dd" target="_blank">including</a> </b>from some of Trump’s top supporters.</p><p>Fight for the Future, a digital rights group that helped lead resistance to the measure, previously announced that they will <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-03-28-breaking-house-of-representatives-votes-to-gut/" target="_blank"><b>unleash billboards</b></a> to expose the lawmakers who voted for the measure. Today, in response to Trump signing the bill, they announced they will add a billboard specifically targeting the President.</p><p>“Donald Trump said he was going to drain the swamp, but it didn’t take long for the swamp to drain him,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, </b>“the only people in the United States who want less Internet privacy are CEOs and lobbyists for giant telecom companies who want to rake in money by spying on all of us and selling the private details of our lives to marketing companies.”</p><p>“It’s deeply ironic that President Trump is expressing outrage about alleged violations of his own privacy while signing legislation that will dramatically expand government surveillance of all Americans,”<b> she added, </b>“President Trump has misjudged his base on this issue. No one wants their Internet Service Provider to sell their information without their permission.”</p><p>Last week, Fight for the Future <b>l</b><a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-03-30-following-congress-attack-on-internet-privacy/" target="_blank"><b>aunched</b> </a>an online resource called #GetSafe, to help Internet users protect their privacy in the wake of Congress’ attack.</p><p><b><a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a> </b>is best known for their role organizing the massive online protests against SOPA, the online censorship bill. and continues to organize many of the largest protests in the history of the Internet.

The measure already passed the Senate last week, so it will now head to the President’s desk for signing.<br/></p><p>Yesterday, digital rights group <a href="http://fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>, known for organizing massive protests against SOPA and for net neutrality announced that they will put up <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-03-27-fight-for-the-future-to-unleash-billboards-to/" target="_blank">billboards</a> with the names of every member of Congress who voted to sell off their constituent’s privacy rights.</p><p>“Today Congress proved once again that they care more about the wishes of the corporations that fund their campaigns than they do about the safety and security of their constituents,” said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future. </p><p>“Gutting these privacy rules won’t just allow Internet Service Providers to spy on us and sell our personal information, it will also enable more unconstitutional mass government surveillance, and fundamentally undermine our cybersecurity by making our sensitive personal information vulnerable to hackers, identity thieves, and foreign governments,” she added.</p><figure data-orig-width="1066" data-orig-height="680" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://68.media.tumblr.com/fc0f3f4f64874df1cc4d4ca882200a2f/tumblr_inline_onjn0ux5HR1ri3xd7_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1066" data-orig-height="680"/></figure><p>The group released a draft <a href="http://imgur.com/a/fN5wy" target="_blank">mock-up</a> of what the initial billboard &ndash; which will be unveiled in Washington, DC and in select districts &ndash; will look like, with the names of the 50 Senators who voted for the bill last week. Today they <a href="https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/846758193162260481" target="_blank">tweeted</a> a mock-up of a billboard targeting Rep Marsha Blackburn, who has taken nearly $700,000 in contributions from telecom companies over her career. </p><p>“Congress should know by now that when you come for the Internet, the Internet comes for you,” Greer added, “these billboards are just the beginning. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, and every lawmaker who votes to take away our privacy will regret it come election day.”</p><p>The public backlash following the party-line vote in the Senate clearly had an impact, as 15 Republicans broke ranks to vote against the controversial measure.</p><p>By using the CRA to gut the FCC broadband privacy rules, lawmakers voted to <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-creepy-things-your-isp-could-do-if-congress-repeals-fccs-privacy-protections" target="_blank">allow</a> ISPs to:</p><p>-Monitor and sell customer’s location data, search history, app usage, and browsing habits to advertisers without your permission</p><p>-Hijack customer’s search results, redirecting their traffic to paying third parties<br/></p><p>-Insert ads into web pages that would otherwise not have them</p><p>Fight for the Future was instrumental in the massive grassroots campaign that successfully pushed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to enact the strongest net neutrality protections in US. history last year.

They plan to launch a crowdfunding campaign to place additional in-district billboards in key lawmakers back yards, which will also include information about how much money in campaign contributions key lawmakers took from the telecom industry.</p><p>“Congress should know by now that when you come for the Internet, the Internet comes for you,” <b>said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, </b>“these billboards are just the beginning. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, and every lawmaker who votes to take away our privacy will regret it come election day.”</p><p>The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the measure as soon as tomorrow.
