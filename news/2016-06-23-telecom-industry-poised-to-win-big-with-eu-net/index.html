        <h1>Telecom industry poised to win big with EU ‘net neutrality’ rules that let them prioritize services of their choosing and throttle VPN and torrent traffic.</h1>

          <span class="date">Posted 16:34 EDT on June 23, 2016</span>


          <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="250" data-orig-width="300"><img data-orig-height="250" data-orig-width="300" alt="image" src="https://s3.fightforthefuture.org/images/blog/tumblr_inline_o9aqb2soAq1u3ugzc_500.gif"/></figure><p>After being besieged by telecom lobbyists, the European Union’s 
communications regulatory body, BEREC, has issued “net neutrality” 
guidelines that let ISPs prioritize certain services and throttle whole 
classes of traffic, like VPNs, BitTorrent, or videochat. The proposal is
 in a final public comment period that ends on July 18.</p><p>Under the 
proposal, ISPs are instructed to discriminate against classes of traffic
 when managing their networks. The rules appear to be designed to 
prevent commercial considerations when deciding what to throttle—and 
that’s a good thing—but the wording of the regulation could lead to 
forms of discrimination that are even more far reaching. For example, 
peer-to-peer traffic could be throttled before traffic from streaming 
video services, even if the peer-to-peer service is in fact using less 
bandwidth. VPN traffic could be throttled simply because ISPs wouldn’t 
be able to determine what category it is.</p><p>And this mass throttling
 could be done as a standard operating procedure, not just for times 
when there is excessive congestion on a network. Under the rules, ISPs 
can engage in class-based throttling whenever they believe congestion is
 “impending,” which, if you consider the chaotic nature of the Internet,
 could really be whenever.</p><p>Another major loophole in the rules is 
the ability for ISPs to engage in zero rating, a practice that has been 
around in Europe for a while and is a big part of why online innovation 
has been sluggish there. Under zero rating, ISPs exempt their own apps 
and services, and those of their partners, from monthly data caps. These
 arrangements incentivize ISPs to reduce data allowances (EU ISPs that 
engage in zero rating give, on average,<a href="http://dfmonitor.eu/" target="_blank"> 50% less data</a> each month for the same price) and they give ISPs more control over what we do online.   </p><p>These
 loopholes allow ISPs to violate net neutrality’s basic principles, and 
they will ensure that Europe’s Internet continues to lag behind the rest
 of the developed world. Innovation will stall under the uncertainties 
created by these provisions, and freedom of expression will be limited 
as ISPs cement their gatekeeper status on the Internet in the EU. Europe
 is the world’s largest economy. What happens to the Internet in Europe 
profoundly affects Internet freedom around the world.</p><p><b>It doesn’t have to be this way.</b></p><p>So
 far, lobbyists for ISPs have been the dominant voices in shaping these 
rules. Europe’s biggest telecom companies, like Deutsche Telekom, 
Orange, and Vodafone, lobbied hard to get the EU Parliament to punt many
 of the most important decisions to BEREC, an unaccountable regulatory 
bureaucracy. The loophole-filled guidelines that BEREC released make it 
clear that the lobbyists were successful. They got more out of BEREC 
than they ever would have been able to get if these decisions were made 
in the original legislation. </p><p>Now it’s our turn. BEREC has opened a
 comment period to hear from the public before they give their final 
approval. This comment period only stays open for a matter of weeks, so 
if you want your voice heard you need to act quick. You do not have to 
live in the European Union to take action.</p><p>This is our chance to 
let them know we want strong net neutrality rules. If enough of us speak
 up, we can beat the lobbyists and get these loopholes fixed. It’s how 
real net neutrality was won in the United States, and it’s how India 
defeated Facebook’s offensive “Free Basics” zero-rating scheme and 
passed net neutrality rules instead. We can do the same in Europe, but 
we have to act now.</p><p><b><a href="http://www.savenetneutrality.eu/" target="_blank">We’ve made it super simple to submit a comment to BEREC in support of net neutrality.
