				<h1 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">We Did It! GoDaddy has officially pulled their support of SOPA & PIPA. 22,000 Boycotters pledged to move over 82,000 domain names from GoDaddy over the boycott period. Thank You!</h1>

				<p><strong>Boycott GoDaddy until they send a letter to Congress taking back any and all support of the House and Senate versions of the internet censorship bill, both SOPA and <a href="/pipa/">PIPA</a>.</strong> Since the announcement of the boycott of GoDaddy, GoDaddy <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/12/victory-boycott-forces-godaddy-to-drop-its-support-for-sopa.ars">has just publicly</a> dropped their support of the heinous Stop Online Piracy Act or SOPA. But, they still support the Senate version of SOPA, called PIPA or PROTECT-IP. If you work on the internet and do business with GoDaddy you're supporting a company who is actively working against your best interests.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/nmnie/godaddy_supports_sopa_im_transferring_51_domains/">Reddit user selfprodigy got the ball rolling on December 22nd</a> by posting that he would be pulling 51 GoDaddy-registered domains from the company. He was quickly followed by Ben Huh of Cheezburger (I Can Has Cheeseburger, FAIL! Blog, Know Your Meme) <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/22/cheezburgers-ben-huh-if-godaddy-supports-sopa-were-taking-our-1000-domains-elsewhere/">who pledged to move 1000+ of the companies domains</a>. Even Wikipedia is transferring their domains from GoDaddy. We want you to follow their lead. Can we get GoDaddy's attention?</p>

				<p>Several other domain registration services have publicly proclaimed their opposition to SOPA and PIPA: <a href="https://www.hover.com/blog/hover-opposes-sopa">Hover</a>, <a href="http://community.namecheap.com/blog/2011/12/22/we-say-no-to-sopa/">NameCheap</a> and <a href="http://blog.dreamhost.com/2011/11/22/dont-drop-the-soap-drop-sopa/">Dreamhost</a>, and <a href="http://blog.name.com/2011/12/getting-on-our-sopa-box-and-saving-you-money/">Name.com</a> to name a few. Many will even give you a special discount if you're switching from GoDaddy. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5870649/ditch-godaddys-sopa+loving-butt-and-get-a-better-web-host-at-a-discount">Lifehacker has a good list of alternatives</a> and some <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5794507/how-to-jump-ship-from-godaddy-to-a-better-web-host">instructions</a>.</p>
