## The University has spent $175,000 to scrub the incident from the Internet. Instead they should commemorate it by putting a statue of the pepper-spraying cop on campus.

In November 2011, UC Davis police officer John Pike pepper sprayed, at point-blank range, dozens of students who were peacefully protesting against a tuition hike. Officer Pike used military-grade MK-9, one of the most potent pepper sprays available, and he conducted the operation with a casual diregard for public safety.

The [Sacramento Bee](http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/education/article71659992.html) recently reported that UC Davis hired consultants to try to erase the incident from the Internet. According to documents they obtained, the University paid a public relatinos firm called Nevins & Associates to "clean up the negative attention the Univesity of California, Davis and Chancellor Katehi have received" and to "expedite the eradication of references to the pepper spray incident in search results."

Censoring history will only make violence against peaceful protestors more likely in the future. As an educational institution, UC Davis should place knowledge and truth above branding public relations. Rather than covering it up, UC Davis Chancellor Linda Katehi should commemorate the pepper-spraying incident by erecting a permanent statue of Office Pike on campus.
