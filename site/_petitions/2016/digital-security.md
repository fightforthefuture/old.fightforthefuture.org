## Digital Security is Physical Safety

The technically [inept](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-encryption-back-door-20160420-story.html) co-chairs of the Senate Intelligence Committee have drafted a bill that would undo current digital security technologies instead of protecting our sensitive data and physical safety.

The Burr-Feinstein bill would [require](http://recode.net/2016/04/14/the-tech-community-is-mobilizing-against-the-burr-feinstein-encryption-bill/) companies to render information “intelligible” for government investigation upon request. This means building a backdoor into anything protected by encryption, making us particularly vulnerable to bad actors. Encryption is crucial to our safety - it protects not just our virtual lives but also our hospitals, airports and power plants.

Security experts are [saying](http://www.wired.com/2016/04/senates-draft-encryption-bill-privacy-nightmare/) this is one of the most “ridiculous, technologically illiterate, and outright dangerous pieces of legislation that Congress has cooked up. Ever.”

By putting this naive and wrong-headed bill forward, Burr and Feinstein have proved themselves incapable of protecting the public’s best interests as the leaders of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Either Burr and Feinstein don’t understand the ramifications of their bill, or they do and they aim to hurt American security and privacy. Either scenario is a fireable offense.

### Sign now to tell Senate Leadership: “Digital security is physical safety. Remove Senators Burr and Feinstein from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence”
