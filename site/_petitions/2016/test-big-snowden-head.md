## This is a big ass headline, up to two lines

President Obama just gave Malaysia a thumbs up on human rights so that he can pass the TPP—despite finding mass graves of sex trafficking victims.

U.S. Congress recently passed a law giving President Obama “fast track” authority to secretly negotiate trade deals like the [Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)][00], a massive agreement that could lead to Internet censorship, lost jobs, and worse. But the legislation had a caveat: the executive branch can’t use this authority enter into deals with countries like Malaysia that have the worst records on abuses like human trafficking.

**Rather than pushing for Malaysia to clean up its act and address the crisis, the Obama Administration has a simple solution: just upgrade Malaysia’s human rights “ranking” on paper, and ignore the recently discovered mass graves of young women forced into sex slavery. It’s a win-win for big government and big corporations and a disaster for human rights worldwide.**

The U.S. government has hit a new low. As a country we can and must do better. Sign and share the petition to demand our leaders respect human rights.
